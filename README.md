# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The reason for making this project was to deliver the weather for a specific city to a user as well as the 5 day future forecast. The problem it solves is to give the user access to weather. I learned how to do API calls and use the returned data as elements on my page. 


## Installation

I started by creating the html, css, and javascript and once I added all my code into the repo i deployed the webpage using github pages. 

## Usage

GitHub App: https://carsonjames1125.github.io/weatherapp-dashboard/
